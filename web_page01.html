                <p><h2>Okay! Alexa</h2></p>
            <P>Digital assistants are poised to follow the smartphone as the next great technological phenomenon. Alexa was the first significant entrant into the market, and her head start remains advantageous as the likes of Google (Google Assistant), Apple (Siri), Microsoft (Cortona) and Samsung (Bixby) play catch-up.

                Amid the rapid adoption of digital assistants, smart speakers can now be found in more than 7% of American homes. Analysts expect that number to grow tenfold by 2020—just two years from now. Meanwhile, Alexa’s share of that market remains above 70%.
                
                And her footprint is globalizing: In December, 2017, Amazon announced a major international expansion in which Echo devices would enter 80 new countries. Following the 2017 holiday season, Amazon had sold tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices from the Echo family.
                
                Despite their nascency, digital assistants are already influencing behavioral shifts. In a survey by Dashbot, nearly 75% of respondents reported to use a voice assistant at least once daily, with nearly 60% using one more than once. Only 20% said their assistants had no impact on their behavior or daily routines.
                
                Those mounting behavior shifts present threats and opportunities to businesses across industries. Already, 40% of millennials make purchases via voice assistants, and more than half will do so by 2020.
                
                As the adoption of Alexa accelerates, so too will her technological advancement. Eager to capitalize on shifting consumer behaviors and an emerging market, more companies will develop skills, thus enhancing the Alexa experience and fueling her development.
                
                Alexa is advancing by the day. It’s her captivating evolutionary journey that inspired The Assistant, and we’re thrilled for you to join us.</P>
